## üöÄ Project Overview

This is a continuation of a project originally developed for a competition. Development is ongoing without a strict deadline. I am focused on improving the code structure, adding new features, and practicing in-depth work with Git and GitHub. The project aims to follow the [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) workflow for development.

## ‚ú® First version
